## Rive Overview

[Rive](https://rive.app) is a real-time interactive design and animation tool that helps teams create and run interactive animations anywhere. Designers and developers use our collaborative editor to create motion graphics that respond to different states and user inputs. Our lightweight open-source runtime libraries allow them to load their animations into apps, games, and websites.

## Supported Devices

Because this runtime library has a dependency on the [Rive Android](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-android) and [Rive iOS](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-ios) runtimes, the supported devices align with each of these dependencies minimum supported devices, as well as the minimum device requirements of the React Native framework.

- iOS: **14.0+**
- Android:
  - Minimum SDK version: **21**
  - Target SDK version: **31**

## Examples

Check out the `example/` folder to run an example application using the Rive React Native runtime. It runs on the local build of this library, and showcases a number of ways to use the Rive component and `useRef` hook pattern:

- Setting a Rive file via a URL, or asset in the Android/iOS projects
- Setting layout and loop mode options
- Displaying single or multiple animations / artboards on one component
- Setting up and maniuplating a state machine via inputs
- ...and more!
